Re# This is the README for 11_shrodi NLP project.

# This folder contains:
    -LSTM_sonnet.ipynb - the main code for the project.
    -model.yaml - the details of the architecture of the model
    -weights-30-0.772.hdf5 - the weights of the LSTM model after 30 epochs of training.
    -sonnets.txt is our dataset file. It contains all 154 sonnets originally written by Shakespeare.

# To run our code:
1) Open LSTM_sonnet.ipynb on Google Colab
2) Enter authentication code for Colab to access your Google Drive account.
3) Make sure that model.yaml, weights-30-0.772.hdf5 and sonnets.txt exist inside your Google Drive at /My Drive/NLP_Project.
4) Run each cell consecutively and make sure a GPU run time is selected.
